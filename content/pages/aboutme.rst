About Me
########

My name is Jonathan Hood, and I am a professional embedded software developer. I am currently employed at ADTRAN as a design engineer. I studied Software Engineering at Mississippi State University. There, I worked on the MSU EcoCar Team on the digital gauge cluster and infotainment center projects. I primary develop for web sites and embedded systems, though I have tinkered with other areas. I'm hugely interested in development of software for linux based embedded systems and maintenance of linux based servers.

I've created this site as a way to remember some of the lessons I've learned. This site also serves as a repository for projects I've finished working on. Maybe the projects will be useful to someone else as well, if it is useful to you please email me!

Thanks,

Jonathan Hood (me@jonathanhood.org)
